This project was created with React and MongoD. This is the first collaboration between Jeffrey and Salem.

This app displays music videos. Any user can add their favorite music video to the home page. The page displays the song, artist, name, album, and genre. This app does not fact check so we are hoping are users use this application appropriately.

There is a button that hide and displays the video and another button that hides and displays the tracks info to update.
